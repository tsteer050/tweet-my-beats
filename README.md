#TweetMyBeats

TweetMyBeats is a web-app built using Node.js, Express, and React.  Its main feature is a step-sequencer, an instrument which allows users to create beats by activating buttons on a grid where the y axis represents different instruments and the x axis represents positions in time where those instruments can be triggered to play.  This section was built using the Web Audio API to create the audio signal chain and custom React components for the interactive pieces.
